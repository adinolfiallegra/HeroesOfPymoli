Implementation of Analysis that aims to analyze the data provided from the gaming company to look at the trend of the most recent fantasy game called Heroes of Pymoli. I analyzed the gender distribution of the players, the first 5 players who purchased the most, the most popular items sold and the most profitable items. This Analysis gives a better overview on the trend of the new game.
Description of three observable trends based on the data:
Even if the second dataset is smaller than the first one, we can assume a lot of similar conclusion.
1.	80% of the players on Dataset are Male
2.	The player’s age of those who purchased the most are in the range of 20-24 years 	
3.	Both datasets show that biggest part of the population made just one –item purchase, and for those who made more than one purchase they did not buy more than 2 items.
